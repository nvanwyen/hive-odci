This directory is the "exploded" jar files needed for the
Oracle loadjava utility to load and resolve for Hive JDBC
as a java stored procedure, using ODCI

The hive-jdbc-thin directory structure is a merge of the 
following JAR releases, in an effort to ensure that *all*
classes can be resolved within a single/complete JAR file
which is based on the following release distributions ...

    * hive-jdbc-0.14.0.2.2.9.7-2-standalone
    * hadoop-common-2.6.0
    * hadoop-auth-2.6.0

The license information, Manifest, etc... information has been combined
into singular files when applicable. For example the "META-INF/MANIFEST.MF"
is a combination of all 3 JAR files, whereas the "META-INF/services" is
a combination of "hive-jdbc-0.14.0.2.2.9.7-2-standalone/META-INF/services" and
"hadoop-common-2.6.0/META-INF/services".

The merging of information is a best effort attempt and may *not* be fully
or completely complaint with the original projects intention. if this is
the case, then all apologies as it was not intended. if a license, concept,
or intention of the original projects has been violated or compromised then
please let me know and I will correct.
