X0Y84.T=Too much contention on sequence {0}. This is probably caused by an uncommitted scan of the SYS.SYSSEQUENCES catalog. Do not query this catalog directly. Instead, use the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_PEEK_AT_SEQUENCE function to view the current value of a query generator.

XCL33.S=The table cannot be defined as a dependent of table {0} because of delete rule restrictions. (The relationship is self-referencing and a self-referencing relationship already exists with the SET NULL delete rule.) 
XCL24.S=Parameter {0} appears to be an output parameter, but it has not been so designated by registerOutParameter().  If it is not an output parameter, then it has to be set to type {1}.
